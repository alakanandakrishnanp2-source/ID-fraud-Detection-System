A prototype system designed to analyze uploaded **ID document images** and generate a **fraud risk assessment report** indicating whether the document appears genuine or suspicious.

The project demonstrates how **computer vision techniques and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** can be used to detect potential tampering in identity documents.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Identity verification plays an important role in many digital systems such as:

- Banking applications
- Online identity verification
- KYC systems
- Digital onboarding platforms

However, detecting **manipulated or forged ID documents** is a difficult task.

This project introduces a **prototype fraud detection service** that analyzes uploaded ID document images and evaluates the likelihood of tampering using multiple image analysis techniques.

The system generates a **fraud risk score and analysis report** based on the detected anomalies in the image.

---

# 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Accept ID document images through an API endpoint
- Validate the uploaded image format
- Perform image tampering analysis
- Extract text from the document using OCR
- Generate a structured fraud detection report

The goal is to demonstrate a **conceptual approach to image-based fraud detection using AI tools**.

# 🧠 Fraud Detection Techniques

The system performs several image analysis techniques to detect potential tampering.

## Blur Detection

Blur detection identifies whether the image is excessively blurred.  
Manipulated or edited images sometimes introduce blur artifacts.

## Edge Detection

Edge analysis evaluates the structure of edges in the image.  
Inconsistent or unnatural edges may indicate editing or manipulation.

## Error Level Analysis (ELA)

ELA is a digital image forensics technique that detects manipulated areas by analyzing compression differences within the image.

Edited regions typically have different compression levels compared to the rest of the image.

## OCR Text Extraction

Text is extracted from the document using **Tesseract OCR**, allowing the system to analyze visible information present in the ID document.

## File Description

### main.py

Main FastAPI application file.  
Handles image uploads, validation, analysis, and report generation.

---

### image_validator.py

Validates whether the uploaded file is a supported image format such as:

- JPG  
- JPEG  
- PNG  

---

### fraud_detector.py

Performs the core image analysis including:

- Blur detection  
- Edge detection  
- Error Level Analysis  
- OCR text extraction  

---

### report_generator.py

Calculates the fraud risk score and generates the final fraud detection report.

---

### uploads/

Stores uploaded images temporarily for processing.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ID-Fraud-Detection.git
cd ID-Fraud-Detection
```

---

### Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

---

### Activate Virtual Environment

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The application will run at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 📄 API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation using **Swagger UI**.

Open in browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

From this interface you can:

- Upload ID document images
- Execute the fraud detection API
- View the generated fraud report

---

## 📊 Fraud Risk Scoring

The system calculates a fraud risk score based on detected anomalies.

| Condition | Score |
|----------|------|
| Blur detected | +30 |
| Low edge consistency | +30 |
| High ELA score | +40 |

### Decision Rule

```
Risk Score 0 – 50 → Likely Genuine
Risk Score > 50 → Suspicious Document
```

---

## 📥 Example API Response

```json
{
 "risk_score": 65,
 "status": "Suspicious Document",
 "analysis": {
   "blur_detected": false,
   "edge_score": 0.02,
   "ela_score": 25,
   "extracted_text": "Name: John Doe"
 }
}
```
